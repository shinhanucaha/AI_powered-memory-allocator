# AI-Powered Custom Memory Allocator

A custom memory allocator implemented in C that simulates dynamic heap memory management using a free-list strategy, logs allocation behavior, and applies machine learning to analyze and predict future memory allocation patterns.

---

## Project Overview

Modern operating systems rely on efficient memory allocators to manage heap memory, minimize fragmentation, and improve performance.  
This project explores how memory allocators work internally and demonstrates how data-driven techniques can be applied to analyze allocation behavior.

The project includes:
- A custom memory allocator (`my_malloc`, `my_free`)
- Allocation and deallocation logging
- Machine learning–based analysis of memory usage patterns

---

## Key Features

- Custom dynamic memory allocator implemented in C
- Free-list based memory block management
- Block metadata tracking (size, allocation status, next pointer)
- Allocation and deallocation logging to CSV
- Memory state visualization for debugging
- Machine learning–based prediction of future allocation sizes

## How the Allocator Works

Each allocated memory block contains metadata including:
- Size of the allocated block
- Allocation status (free or used)
- Pointer to the next block in the free list

The allocator works as follows:
1. Searches the free list for a suitable free block
2. Reuses freed blocks when possible
3. Requests new memory from the system heap when needed
4. Tracks allocation and deallocation events through logging

The allocator operates safely within the process heap and does not interfere with system-wide memory management.

---

## Logging and Data Collection

All allocation activity is logged to a CSV file located at `data/alloc_log.csv`.

Example log format:

```
ALLOC,32
ALLOC,64
FREE
ALLOC,128
```

These logs represent real memory allocation behavior generated by the custom allocator and are used as input for the machine learning phase.

## Machine Learning Analysis

The project uses Python to analyze memory allocation traces:
- Allocation logs are loaded using Pandas
- Allocation events are filtered and processed
- A Decision Tree Regressor is trained on historical allocation data
- Future allocation sizes are predicted based on learned patterns

This demonstrates how AI techniques can be applied to system-level behavior analysis.

## How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Compile and Run the Allocator

```bash
gcc main.c allocator.c logger.c -o allocator.exe
./allocator.exe
```

### Step 2: Run Machine Learning Analysis

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas scikit-learn
python analyze_allocations.py
```
